## Description
This project is a **student registration system** where you can add student profiles and see them as cards and in a table.  

- The form checks that you fill in all required fields and gives error messages if something is missing.  
- Each student gets a **profile card** and a row in a **summary table**.  
- You can **edit** or **remove** profiles.  
- You can **search** to quickly find students.  
- Profiles are saved in your browser, so they stay even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- Form validation for required fields and email format.  
- Dynamic profile cards with photo, name, programme, year, interests, and action buttons.  
- Summary table synced with the cards.  
- Edit profiles by repopulating the form and updating the card/table.  
- Remove profiles from both card and table.  
- Search/filter by name, programme, year, or interests.  
- LocalStorage keeps profiles after reload.  
- Works on small and large screens.
